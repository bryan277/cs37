Control structures
-sequence (its build in C++ and most language)
-selection
 - if                 ?  :
 - if/else  |  conditional operator
 - switch


 if (grade >= 60)
    cout << "Passed";
  else
    cout << "Failed";

cout << (grade >= 60 ? "Passed" : "Failed");


Repetition/iteration
-while loop
-do/while (it guarantues goes through at least once)
-for loop

Variables
-named storage loaction/memory
  -attributes
   - Type
   - size - how much memory allocated
   - value - value assigned to the Variable in the program
   - scope - where in the program the Variable can be used/has a certain meaning
   - address - the actual location in memory
   - "normal"
   - pointer  int *iptr = &x;
   - deference y = *iptr; // the star is the deference
   - reference
      - defines an alternative name/Identifiers for an existing object
        - alias (like people (Bill))
        int ival = 1024;
        int &refVal = ival; //&refVal is the reference
        refVal = refVal*2;                                  ival/reVal = 2048
        - must be inialized when defined
         -int &refVal3; DONT DO THIS


Functions
  - break program into smaller pieces
   - divide/conquer
  - software reuse
  - avoid repeating code DRY dont repeat yourself
  - declared
    - prototype
  - defined
    - the actual code of the function
  - called/invoked
    - actually making use of the function (main is the main boss)
  - return type
    - may or may not have one
      - Void - if not returning
  - passing arguments
      - by value
      - by address/pointer
      - by reference
