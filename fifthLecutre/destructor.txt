Destructor
- has the same name as the class but prefixed by a '~' (tilde)
    ~ Rectangle():g
- has no return type
- cannot be overloaded
- cannot be called explicitly


Destructors are useful for doing "housekeeping" -release memory that has been allocated dynamically 


class Rectangle
{
    private:
        int *height, *length;
    public:
        Rectangle(int ight = 0, int ilen = 0);
       ~Rectangle();
};

Rectangle::Rectangle(int ihgt, int ilen)
{
    height = new int;
    length = new int;

    *height = ihgt;
    *length = ilen;
}

Rectangle::~Rectangle()
{
    delete height;
    delete length;
}

Rectangle myR1(5, 7);
