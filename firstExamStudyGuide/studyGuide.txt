Preprocessor directives:
    #include <iostream>
    - it is the predefined used for input and output and is also called header files
    - iostream is the header file which contains all the functions of program like cout, cin etc. and # inlcude tells the preprocessor to inlcude these header file in the program
    - allows you to write shorter code
    #include <iomanip>
    - It defines the manipulator functions resestiosflags(), setiosflags(), setbase(), setfill(), 
    setprecision(), and setw(). These functions may be convenietly used by C++ 
    prgrams to affect the state of iostream objects.
    #include <string>
    - cout << "this is a string" In order to use the string data type, c++ string header <string> must be included at the top of the program. Also, 
    you'll need to include using namespace std; to make the short string visible instead of requiring the cumbersome std::string


cout-
    - default device its associated with it (stream insertion operator)
        <<
    - default justification
        - The default is right-justified
    - default precision
        - The default precision is 6 spaces
        - int main()
            {
                double pi = 4.123123123123;
                std::cout << "default precision (6): " << pi << '\n'
                        << "std::setprecision(10): " << std::setprecision(10) << pi << '\n';
            }

            // default precision (6): 3.14159
            // std::setprecision(10): 3.141592654
            


cin- 
    - default device its associated with it (stream extraction operator)
        >> 
    - limitations in terms of strings

    - how it handles white space

manipulators
    -endl
        - Inserts a new-line character and flushes the stream
        - Its behavior is equivalent to calling os.put('/n')
        - cout << x << endl; is equivalent to cout << x << '\n';
                                              cout.flush();
    
    -fixed
        - sets the floatfield format flag for the str stream to fixed

    -left
        - sets the adjustfield format flag for the str stream to left 

    -right 
        - sets the adjustfield format flag for the str stream to right 

    - setw
        - sets the field width to be used on output operations 


    functions and methods
        - getline()
            - Extracts characters from is and stores them into str until the delimitation character delim is found (or the newline character, '\n', for (2)).

        - cin.ignore()
            -

    Variables:
        - definition of different types
            - bool
                - stores either value true or false
            - char 
                - Typically a single octet (one byte). This is an integer type
            - int
                - The most natural size of integer for the machine
            - float 
                - single-precisision floating point value
            - double
                - a double-precision floating point value
            - void
                - represents the absence of type
    Variables (copy paste from notes)
            -named storage loaction/memory
            -attributes
            - Type
            - size - how much memory allocated
            - value - value assigned to the Variable in the program
            - scope - where in the program the Variable can be used/has a certain meaning
            - address - the actual location in memory
            - "normal"
            - pointer  int *iptr = &x;
            - deference y = *iptr; // the star is the deference
            - reference
                - defines an alternative name/Identifiers for an existing object
                    - alias (like people (Bill))
                    int ival = 1024;
                    int &refVal = ival; //&refVal is the reference
                    refVal = refVal*2;                                  ival/reVal = 2048
                    - must be inialized when defined
                    -int &refVal3; DONT DO THIS
    
        - "normal"
            -
